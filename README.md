Hi, I'm Jacob Gilliam.
I am currently a senior at the University of Alabama studying Computer Science, with an expected graduation date of May 2023.
This profile contains a repository of some of my noteable school projects that I've completed so far.
Each one will have a description of the project in the README section.
I am very interested in AI/machine learning and computer graphics. Also an interest in creating video games (As im sure almost every programmer my age is).

If you need to reach me please email me at jagilliam20@gmail.com
